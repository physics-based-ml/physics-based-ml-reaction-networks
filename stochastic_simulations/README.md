# Stochastic simulations

This directory contains subfolders related to the stochastic simulation training data.

* [ml_training_data](ml_training_data) - Code to run the actual stochastic simulations, and the data from them.
* [oscillation_range](oscillation_range) - Makes the range of oscillations resulting from the stochastic simulations, and the corresponding Figure~2 in the paper.
* [no_ip3rs](no_ip3rs) - Explores what reasonable values for the number of `IP3Rs` are under different assumptions (supplemental material).
