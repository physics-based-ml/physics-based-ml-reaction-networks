# Range of oscillations from stochastic simulations and bifurcation diagram of De Young & Keizer

This directory analyzes the stochastic simulations from the [ml_training_data](../ml_training_data) directory. It generates the range of oscillatons in the stochastic model.

* `funcs_oscillation_range.nb` contains the functions to generate the bifurcation diagram and range of oscillations. The package is automatically generated - it is the `bifurcation_diagrams.m` file.
* `figures` has the resulting figures.
* `oscillation_range.nb` generates the range of oscillations. They are stored in the `oscillation_range_data` folder.
